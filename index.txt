Tokens vs JWTs (Json Web Tokens)

// WHY DO WE NEED JWTs OVER TOKENS?

when we sign-in with our username and pw, we get back a random token 
which we eventually use by passing /me endpoint 
but this hits the database (in our case the users array) eveytime we hit the /me endpoint
every time the user sends the req (/me) via the token, it hits the entire database, goes through it and searches for the token
after finding the token, it gets the username and pw in the database and then returns you the info you need
which is long and completed process

what if we dont want it to be that completed 

hence we use JWTs 

when the user signs in with username and pw, the token they get back isn't randomly generated anymore
the token somehow contains the username of the user too to make it recognizable, obviously it is encrypted
hence we dont have to store the token generated in the database
so whenever the user sends req(/me) via the token, the backend directly decodes the token to the username 
hence hits the database directly with the username and returns you the info you need


tokens are stateful i.e we need to store it in the og database
JWTs are stateless i.e we dont have to store it anywhere
